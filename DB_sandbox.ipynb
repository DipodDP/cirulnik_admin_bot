    "### Engine\n",
    "When you create an engine in SQLAlchemy, it does create a connection or connection pool associated with it. However, the connections in the pool are not instantiated right away.\n",
    "Instead, they are lazily allocated on an as-needed basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "When your application first requests a connection, the engine will create a new connection and hand it over to your session. As more connections are required, the engine will continue to allocate new ones until the maximum pool size is reached. When connections are released back to the pool, they can be reused by other sessions to minimize the overhead of establishing new connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the connection pool is created when you create an engine, but the connections within the pool are only allocated as they are needed. This helps to efficiently manage resources and optimize performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the engine will create a pool of 5 connections. You can change this by passing the `pool_size` parameter to the `create_engine` function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "engine = create_engine(url, pool_size=10)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, there is a thing called `max_overflow`. This parameter controls the number of connections that can be created above the `pool_size`. The default value is 10, which means that the engine will create a maximum of 15 connections (5 connections in the pool + 10 connections above the pool size).\n",
    "```python\n",
    "engine = create_engine(url, pool_size=5, max_overflow=10) # These are default values\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also set the `pool_recycle` parameter. This parameter controls the maximum age of a connection. If a connection is older than the `pool_recycle` value, it will be closed and replaced with a new connection. The default value is -1, which means that the connections will never be recycled.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "engine = create_engine(url, pool_recycle=3600) # 1 hour\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other parameters that you can set, but these are the most important ones.\n",

    "## Session maker\n",
    "`sessionmaker` is a component in SQLAlchemy that serves as a factory for creating Session objects with a fixed configuration. In a typical application, an Engine object is maintained in the module scope. The sessionmaker can provide a factory for Session objects that are bound to this engine."
